<h1> You can just write your thoughts here.</h1>
<h2> Or rant about whatever grinds your gears </h2>
<h3> Like that Jeremy guy, for example</h3>
<h4> I mean, like what is his deal?</h4>
<h5> Why does he drink so much Coke Zero? Weird...</h5>

This exercise is about nesting div tags. <div> This div contains this text and the div tag below. <div> Hi! I'm the div tag that was mentioned in my parent div. I contain this text and two other children divs. <div> Hi, our parent was just taking about us. Please indent us properly. </div><div> Hi, our parent was just taking about us. </div></div></div>

This exercise is about making lists

Here's what I like about lists:
<ul>
<li> They're useful for displaying lists of stuff.</li>
<li> That's about it </li>
<li> I like lists of three </li>
</ul>
When you make a list, do it in this order:
<ol>
<li> Decide if it's an ordered list or not. </li>
<li> If it's not an ordered list, use the UL tag. Otherwise, use the OL tag. </li>
<ul><li> Use LI tags nested in the list for your list items. </li></ul>
<ol><li> Curveball! You can nest lists inside each other.</li></ol>
<li> You've got this, probably.

<p> Here's a couple of ways you can express yourself</p>
<ul><li>If you want to sound normal, regular LI tags.</li>
<li><m>If you want to sound interesting, italics.</m></li>
<li><strong>If you want to be annoying, this.</strong></li></ul>
<p><m>I did it</m></p>
